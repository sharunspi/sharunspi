I am sharun , someone who loves building values .
I believe that building great products is creating value in my life. Happiest thing is when one is happy while using the product that i build ‚ù§Ô∏è.

<p>
You can't see me sitting idle , I will explore everything: books , places, arts ....
</p>
<p>
Explored various programming languages to solve problems , but I fell in love with Javascript. As a kid, I loved computers and I loved solving problems using them. I feel the same enthusiasm when I see a problem in front of me . Started the coding journey by building a website for my college tech fest.Now I have 3+ years of experience in the domain.
